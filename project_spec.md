Product Spec

App Name: Cute CBS (Cat, Bird, Shibes)

App Criteria
-
**Mobile:**  
-This is more than a website because  cute images would be displayed without clutter of ads  and such a feature would be free.  

**Story:**
-I think people would respond well to an app that displays only images of cute animals.  However, it may not be clear that one could use it for more than inspiration.

**Market:**
-If this app were to go live, there might not be a lot of users due to competition. We would need a fair amount of advertisement.
-I think this app would be popular like how Pinterest is but more niche. 
-I think artists would use this app for inspiration and a regular user would use this app for good vibes and happiness.

**Habit:** 
-The user would open the app and use it often because of the random images each time the app is refreshed. The user will always see something new when the app is refreshed, and that is addicting.
-The user could use the app to create something, it's more of an app for inspiration. You can not create something on this app.

**Scope:**
-I am already familiar with how the API works. However, as a group, we could have some difficulty getting this completed because coordinating meetings is difficult due to differences in timezones and school schedules. We would need to work on a scaled-down version of this app with not too many complicated features.
-Even though this might not be the most polished app, I think it would still be interesting to build.
-This product's purpose is to display random images of dogs, cats, or birds in a vertical list that is scrollable.  Other features would only help to enhance the app.

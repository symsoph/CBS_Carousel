### Sofia's Ideas
**1) For inspiration: Scrollable list of random dog, cat, bird photos**
* https://shibe.online/  : https://shibe.online/api/birds , https://shibe.online/api/cats , https://shibe.online/api/shibes

**Mobile:**  
-This is more than a website because  cute images would be displayed without clutter of ads  and such a feature would be free.  

**Story:**
-I think people would respond well to an app that displays only images of cute animals.  However, it may not be clear that one could use it for more than inspiration.

**Market:**
-If this app were to go live, there might not be a lot of users due to competition. We would need a fair amount of advertisement.
-I think this app would be popular like how Pinterest is but more niche. 
-I think artists would use this app for inspiration and a regular user would use this app for good vibes and happiness.

**Habit:** 
-The user would open the app and use it often because of the random images each time the app is refreshed. The user will always see something new when the app is refreshed, and that is addicting.
-The user could use the app to create something, it's more of an app for inspiration. You can not create something on this app.

**Scope:**
-I am already familiar with how the API works. However, as a group, we could have some difficulty getting this completed because coordinating meetings is difficult due to differences in timezones and school schedules. We would need to work on a scaled-down version of this app with not too many complicated features.
-Even though this might not be the most polished app, I think it would still be interesting to build.
-This product's purpose is to display random images of dogs, cats, or birds in a vertical list that is scrollable.  Other features would only help to enhance the app.

2) search artworks from a museum
3) recipe inspiration app - search for a list of recipes under a certain theme/ word

### Eliott's Ideas
1) Some type of Messaging app (probably too difficult)
2) An notebook digitizer and organizer for classes.
**3) An app cointaing a bunch of useless facts by category**
Sofia - I found some..: https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/ (might be broken not sure), https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data (not sure how to use this)

**Mobile:**
*  This idea is not too different from a online website but could still be a fun accessible distraction which stimulates the brain more than scrolling

**Story**
* The value of an app like this is in the quality of the facts included. It requires a somewhat curated and truly unknown fact lists so make it a complelling app.
* Friends and Family would probably somewhat question the app but could find use in the app if they get bored of other media.

**Market**
* An app like this is ofcourse limmited to a certain scale. Not everyone wants filler apps on their phones that they rarely open.
* This app would provide a moderate satisfaction to those who enjoy learning facts and are generally curious. People who do trivia gameshows could also find use in a random fact app.

**Habit**
* A user which uses the app could expect to open the app multiple times a day as there is always time for one more useless fact. 
* The average consumer would typically just comsume the app a feature of the app is that user requested random facts could be added via a form.

**Scope**
* This app would not be too hard to do given a proper API.
* Multiple API calls could be use to diversify the random facts as the more variety the better.
* The product is very well defined as an app that fetches random facts.

### Anthony's Ideas
1) App which selects a random nasa photo of the day and sets it to the phone screen background
2) App which displays a random wikipedia page, I assume they have an API for this**
possible api https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/

3) App which calls a word of the day API and involves some kind of word game

**Mobile:**
* The game aspect of an app like this would be much more enternaning than simply reading a word of the day and its definition.
* Different challenges could allow for better long term remembering of the words

**Story**
* There is a clear app value in learning new words with a fun interactive game
* Peers would positively react to an app like this as long as the word game is fun

**Market**
* There is a large market for an app like this as shown with previous examples like Wordle and other word like games.

**Habit**
* The user would only need to open the app once per day. 
* They would play the game, learn the word and repeat

**Scope**
* The idea is on the more difficult side as creating a game in Kotlin in certaintly not easy.
* There is no clearly defined game type in mind and one would need to be brainstormed.

Final Idea
-
App that displays dog, cat, bird images.
